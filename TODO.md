# TODO
- [ ] Lex float literals
- [ ] Lex hexadecimal literals
- [ ] FANCY Diagnostic rendering, plz
- [ ] Think about freeing source text after lex (until it's needed for diagnostics again, of course)
- [ ] Turn token kinds into more human-readable strings, not just the internal enum representation
- [ ] Parse compound statement/expression (determine if it *is* an expression, with `yield`?)
